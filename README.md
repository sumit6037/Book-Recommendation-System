# Book-Recommendation-System


## Project Summary

 A Recommendation System is a filtration program whose prime goal is to predict the “rating” or “preference” of a user 
 towards a domain-specific item or item. In our case, this domain-specific item is a movie, therefore the main focus of our 
 recommendation system is to filter and predict only those movies which a user would prefer given some data about the user him or herself.


The Objective of the Project is to create a Collaborative filtering which is used by the systems to find similar patterns or information of the users, 
this technique can filter out items that users like on the basis of the ratings or reactions by similar users.

An example of collaborative filtering can be to predict the rating of a particular user based on user ratings for 
other movies and others’ ratings for all movies. This concept is widely used in recommending
movies, news, applications, and so many other items.

`This Project uses User-User-based similarity/Collaborative Filtering which looks for similar users based on the items users 
have already liked or positively interacted with.`
